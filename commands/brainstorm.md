# Brainstorm — Explore Ideas for Current Project

## Before Anything Else: Sync Profile
1. Check the project profile in this Claude Project's context
2. Review the codebase state (ask the user for any recent updates if needed)
3. Move any items from **Planned** or **In Progress** that are now complete → **Current Reality**
4. Confirm the sync: briefly tell the user what moved

## Then: Brainstorm
Help the CTO explore ideas, requirements, and client requests freely.

**Rules:**
- No estimation at this stage — it's too early and wastes effort
- No commitment — everything is exploratory
- Ask clarifying questions to draw out requirements
- Think about technical feasibility based on the project profile's Current Reality
- Consider dependencies on what's already In Progress or Planned
- Flag potential conflicts with existing work

## Output
- Summarize the ideas explored
- For each idea, note: what it is, why it matters, rough technical direction
- Add output to the **Under Consideration** section of the project profile
